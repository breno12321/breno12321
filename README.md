## Hi, I'm Breno Oliveira ðŸ‘‹

<!-- <p><em> Graduating in Computer Engineering at <a target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://unifei.edu.br/" >UNIFEI <a><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WoWm8YzFQJg5i/giphy.gif"width="50"/></em></p> -->

I'm a software engineer who loves design, creative environments and the process of creating products. Since I was young I've always been fascinated by technology and how you can impact "normal people" lives through simple and beautiful interactions.

Knowing that, I always challange myself to bring solutions and work on problems that makes the client show the results to his/her wife/husband or even to a friend in a bar conversation. I belive through tecnology we can shape experiences and bring them to live if form of products and, for us devs, code. Sounds goofy, but It's what I truly feel for it ðŸ˜Š

* UX | UI and design driven experiences
